## üîê App Signing Setup

### 1. Keystore Management

The app uses a signing key stored in `android/einsteini-keystore.jks`. 

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical**: Keep your keystore file and passwords secure - losing them means you can't update your app!

#### Configure Key Properties

1. **Create `android/key.properties`**:
   ```properties
   storeFile=../einsteini-keystore.jks
   storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
   keyAlias=YOUR_KEY_ALIAS
   keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
   ```

2. **Secure Your Credentials**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure key.properties is in .gitignore
   echo "android/key.properties" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Verify Signing Configuration** in `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   android {
       signingConfigs {
           release {
               keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
               keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
               storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
               storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
           }
       }
       buildTypes {
           release {
               signingConfig signingConfigs.release
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. Version Management

Current version in `pubspec.yaml`: `3.0.0+22`

**Version Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+BUILD_NUMBER`
- **3.0.0**: User-visible version (versionName)
- **22**: Internal build number (versionCode) - must increment with each release

---

## üèó Release Build Preparation

### 1. Pre-Build Checklist

```bash
# ‚úÖ Update dependencies
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade

# ‚úÖ Run code analysis
flutter analyze

# ‚úÖ Run all tests
flutter test

# ‚úÖ Verify app functionality
flutter run --release
```

### 2. Build App Bundle (Recommended)

```bash
# Build Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release

# Location: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

**Why App Bundle?**
- **Smaller downloads**: Dynamic delivery reduces app size
- **Better performance**: Optimized APKs for different devices
- **Required for new apps**: Google Play requirement since August 2021

### 3. Alternative: Build APK

```bash
# Build APK (if needed)
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi

# Creates separate APKs for different architectures:
# - app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
# - app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
# - app-x86_64-release.apk
```

### 4. Test Release Build

```bash
# Install and test release build
flutter install --release

# Or install specific APK
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

**Test Critical Paths**:
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Overlay permissions work correctly
- [ ] Accessibility service functions properly
- [ ] AI features generate content
- [ ] Subscription flow works
- [ ] Dark/light theme switching
