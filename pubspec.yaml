# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  assets:
    - assets/animations/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/fonts/TikTokSans_28pt-Regular.ttf
    - assets/fonts/TikTokSans_28pt-Medium.ttf
